## 💬 Reflections
Despite having no strong background or personal interest in motorsport, working on this project turned out to be genuinely engaging. The depth of the dataset—even with just 300 rows—allowed me to uncover meaningful trends and appreciate the dynamics of motorcycle racing in a whole new light.

Some challenges included handling inconsistencies in point totals and missing race details. However, tools like Excel proved surprisingly effective for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

This experience reaffirmed one thing: you don’t need to be a fan of the subject matter to discover something interesting in the data. Curiosity, not expertise, is often the best starting point.
